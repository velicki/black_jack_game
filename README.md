Blackjack README


Welcome to Blackjack, a Python implementation of the classic card game. In this game, you'll face off against the dealer in a battle of luck and strategy, aiming to reach as close to 21 points as possible without going over.

______________________________________________

While developing the Blackjack project in Python, I gained several valuable insights and learned important lessons:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: Implementing classes such as Card, Deck, Player, and Blackjack reinforced my understanding of OOP concepts. I learned how to encapsulate data and behavior within classes, promote code reusability, and improve code organization.

2. Game Logic Design: Designing the game logic for Blackjack taught me how to translate game rules into code. I learned about the sequence of actions in a game round, such as dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining winners, and implemented these logic steps effectively.

3. Data Representation: Representing playing cards, decks, and player hands as objects helped me understand the importance of choosing appropriate data structures. I gained experience in working with lists, dictionaries, and objects to represent and manipulate game data efficiently.

4. User Input Handling: Implementing user input handling for player actions (Hit or Stand) improved my understanding of input validation and user interaction in Python programs. I learned how to prompt users for input, validate responses, and process user commands effectively.

5. Game Flow Control: Managing the flow of the game, including round initialization, player turns, dealer actions, and round resolution, taught me how to structure control flow in Python programs. I gained experience in using loops, conditionals, and function calls to orchestrate game sequences smoothly.

6. Error Handling and Debugging: Implementing error handling mechanisms for scenarios such as busting or invalid input improved my skills in error detection and debugging. I learned how to anticipate and handle runtime errors gracefully to ensure the stability and reliability of the game.

7. Code Modularity and Reusability: Organizing the code into separate modules (files) for different game components (e.g., card.py, deck.py, player.py) promoted code modularity and reusability. I learned how to structure code effectively, separate concerns, and encapsulate functionality within modules.


Overall, developing the Blackjack project expanded my Python programming skills, reinforced my understanding of OOP principles, and provided hands-on experience in game development, error handling, and project documentation. It was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my proficiency as a Python developer and prepared me for future projects and challenges

How to Play


Installation: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The game uses Python 3.x.

Run the Game: Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the blackjack.py file, and run the following command: python blackjack.py

Player's Turn: You have the option to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand). Input your choice when prompted.

Dealer's Turn: After the player stands, the dealer reveals card and continues to draw cards until their hand reaches a score of 17 or higher.

End of Round: Once both the player and dealer have completed their turns, the round ends. The winner is determined based on the highest total score without exceeding 21 points.

Game Components
blackjack.py
This file contains the main game logic for Blackjack. It initializes the game, handles player actions (Hit or Stand), manages scoring, and determines the outcome of each round.

card.py
Defines the Card class, which represents individual playing cards in the game. Each card has a value, suit, and corresponding graphical representation for display.

deck.py
Implements the Deck class, representing a deck of cards used in the game. It generates a standard deck of 52 cards, allows drawing cards, and keeps track of the remaining cards in the deck.

player.py
Defines the Player class, representing players in the game (both the player and the dealer). It manages the player's hand, handles card drawing, calculates the total score, and displays the player's hand.
